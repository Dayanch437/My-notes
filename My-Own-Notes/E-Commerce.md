E-commerce (electronic commerce) refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It has become a cornerstone of modern business, enabling companies and individuals to reach global markets, streamline operations, and provide convenience to customers. Below is a comprehensive guide on how e-commerce should be structured, including key components, best practices, and strategies for success.
