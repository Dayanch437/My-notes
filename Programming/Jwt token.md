In Django with JWT (JSON Web Token), **access** and **refresh tokens** are used for user authentication and session management. Here's how they work:

### 1. **Access Token:**

- **Purpose:** The access token is a short-lived token used to authenticate the user for each request to protected routes.
    
- **Lifetime:** Usually expires in a short time (e.g., 15 minutes to an hour) to ensure security.
    
- **Content:** It contains information about the user (like user ID, roles, etc.) and is signed using a secret key, ensuring that it cannot be tampered with.
    
- **Usage:** When a user logs in, the server issues an access token. This token is included in the `Authorization` header of each subsequent request as `Bearer <access_token>`.
    
- **Expiration:** When the access token expires, the user will need to refresh it.
    

### 2. **Refresh Token:**

- **Purpose:** The refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when the original access token expires.
    
- **Lifetime:** Typically longer-lived (e.g., days or weeks).
    
- **Content:** It usually contains less information and is only used to request a new access token.
    
- **Usage:** When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to the server, and the server returns a new access token (and possibly a new refresh token).
    
- **Security:** Refresh tokens are typically stored securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies) to prevent unauthorized access.
    

### Flow:

1. **Login (Initial Authentication):**
    
    - User logs in with their credentials.
        
    - Server verifies the credentials and returns both an access token and a refresh token.
        
2. **Request with Access Token:**
    
    - The client sends requests with the access token in the `Authorization` header.
        
    - If the access token is valid, the server processes the request.
        
3. **Access Token Expiry:**
    
    - When the access token expires, the client sends the expired access token along with the refresh token to the server.
        
4. **Refreshing the Access Token:**
    
    - The server verifies the refresh token.
        
    - If valid, the server generates a new access token and optionally a new refresh token and sends it back to the client.
        
5. **Logout:**
    
    - On logout, both the access token and refresh token should be invalidated to end the user's session.
        

### Implementation in Django:

You can use libraries like `djangorestframework-simplejwt` to easily manage JWT tokens. It allows you to create views for obtaining access and refresh tokens.
