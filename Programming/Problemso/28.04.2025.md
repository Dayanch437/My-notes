Given two numbers **A** and **B** (A < B), find the sum of all integers between A and B **(not including A and B)**.

**Example:**  
If A = 3 and B = 8 → numbers between are 4, 5, 6, 7 → sum = 22

~~~python
a = int(input("Enter A: "))
b = int(input("Enter B: "))
total = 0
for i in range(a + 1, b):
    total += i
print(total)
~~~


**Problem:**  
Given a positive integer **N**, find the **product** of all even numbers from **1** to **N** (including N if N is even).  
If there are no even numbers, output 1.

**Example:**

- If N = 6 → even numbers are 2, 4, 6 → product = 2 × 4 × 6 = 48
    
- If N = 5 → even numbers are 2, 4 → product = 2 × 4 = 8

~~~python
n = int(input("Enter N:"))
total = 1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i%2==0:
        total *= i
print(total)
