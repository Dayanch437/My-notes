## 🔄 **Sync (Synchronous)**

### ▶️ How it works:

- Tasks run **one after another**, blocking the next until the current one finishes.
    

### 💡 Example:
```python
def get_data():
    response = requests.get("https://api.com/data")
    print(response.json())

```
- The whole program **waits** until the HTTP request finishes.
    
### ✅ Pros:

- Easier to understand and debug
    
- Default in most Python/Django apps
    
### ❌ Cons:

- **Blocks I/O** — slow if many waiting tasks (e.g., API, DB, file)
    
- Not ideal for high-concurrency apps (like chat, async APIs)

## ⚡ **Async (Asynchronous)**

### ▶️ How it works:

- Tasks **don't block**; they yield control when waiting (e.g., I/O)
    
- Python switches to other tasks using an **event loop**
    

### 💡 Example:
```python import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def get_data():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://api.com/data") as response:
            print(await response.json())

asyncio.run(get_data())

```
- While waiting for HTTP response, Python can run other tasks.
    ### ✅ Pros:

- Handles **thousands of I/O tasks concurrently**
    
- Efficient for real-time apps: chat, websocket, polling, etc.
### ❌ Cons:

- More complex: requires `async/await` everywhere
    
- Many Python libraries are still **not async-ready** (e.g., standard DB drivers)

## 📌 Sync vs Async in Django

|Feature|Sync|Async|
|---|---|---|
|Request handling|WSGI (default)|ASGI (since Django 3.1)|
|View functions|`def my_view(request)`|`async def my_view(request)`|
|Blocking I/O|Blocks|Doesn't block|
|Use case|Standard web apps|Real-time, long-polling, APIs|
|Libraries|Easy (e.g., `requests`)|Requires async libs (`httpx`, `aiohttp`)|

## 🚀 When to Use What?

- Use **sync** for simple, traditional web apps (CRUD, dashboards).
    
- Use **async** for:
    
    - High-performance APIs
        
    - Real-time features (chat, live feed)
        
    - Background I/O (without threads)
