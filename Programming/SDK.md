An **SDK (Software Development Kit)** is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and code samples that developers use to build software for a specific platform, framework, or service.

### Key components of an SDK:

- **APIs**: Interfaces to interact with the platform/service.
    
- **Libraries**: Pre-written code to handle common tasks.
    
- **Documentation**: Guides and references to understand how to use the SDK.
    
- **Tools**: Debuggers, emulators, compilers, etc.
    
- **Sample Code**: Example projects or functions to get started quickly.
    

### Example SDKs:

- **Android SDK**: For developing Android apps.
    
- **Firebase SDK**: For adding Firebase services like auth, database, etc.
    
- **AWS SDK**: For interacting with Amazon Web Services.
    

Think of an SDK as a toolbox that helps you build something specific more easily and correctly.
