Marzban is a web-based management panel designed to simplify the configuration and management of **XRay** and **V2Ray** servers. These are popular tools used for building secure, private network connections (commonly for bypassing restrictions or securing Internet traffic). Marzban provides a **user-friendly interface** for controlling and monitoring these servers, making it easier to manage users, configure proxies, and monitor traffic.

It allows users to set up protocols like **VLESS**, **Shadowsocks**, and **Trojan** on XRay/V2Ray with minimal command-line configuration. Marzban also supports automatic **SSL certificate issuance** via **Let's Encrypt** and has a dashboard for tracking usage and performance.

Marzban is typically set up on a **VPS** (Virtual Private Server) and is accessed via a web interface, offering a much easier and more intuitive way to control and configure these proxies than manually editing configuration files.
