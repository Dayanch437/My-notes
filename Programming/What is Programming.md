 **What is Programming?**

**Programming** is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks. These instructions, written in a programming language, define the logic and behavior of software applications, websites, and systems.

### **Key Aspects of Programming**

1. **Problem Solving** – Breaking down complex problems into logical steps.
2. **Algorithms** – Designing step-by-step procedures to solve problems efficiently.
3. **Code Writing** – Using programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++) to implement solutions.
4. **Debugging** – Identifying and fixing errors in the code.
5. **Testing & Optimization** – Ensuring the program runs correctly and efficiently.

### **Types of Programming** 

- **Procedural Programming** – Organizes code into functions (e.g., C, Pascal).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Uses objects and classes (e.g., Java, Python, C++).
- **Functional Programming** – Focuses on pure functions and immutability (e.g., Haskell, Lisp).
- **Scripting** – Automates repetitive tasks (e.g., Python, Bash).

### **Why is Programming Important?**

- Powers modern technology (apps, websites, AI, cybersecurity).
- Enables automation and efficiency.
- Drives innovation in fields like healthcare, finance, and engineering.
