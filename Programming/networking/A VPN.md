A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet by routing your traffic through a remote server.

### 🔑 Key functions:

1. **Hides your IP address** – Websites and apps see the VPN server’s IP, not yours.
    
2. **Encrypts your data** – Protects your information from hackers, especially on public Wi-Fi.
    
3. **Bypasses geo-blocks** – Lets you access content restricted by location (e.g., Netflix, websites).
    
4. **Masks activity** – Prevents ISPs, governments, or network admins from seeing what sites you visit.
    

### 🛠️ How it works (in simple terms):

Without VPN:
~~~nginx
You → Internet → Website
